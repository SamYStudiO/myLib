11/03/06	v0.7.8
===================================================

===================================================
10/02/27	v0.7.7 beta
===================================================
	Bugs Fixed :
		* Fix compilation error using Flex compiler
		* Fix when using external asset with components sometimes they don't display.
		* Fix ScrollBar bug while dragging thumb and mouse hit up or down asset.
		* Apply custom text to ComboBox now clear current selection cell.
		* Clear selection from ComboBox now set defaultText value to it.
		* With ComboBox if up or down open direction are not enough large to show all opened list, the default open direction set is now applied.
		* Fix sometimes wrong stepper thumb asset layout.
		* Fix default text not removed with TextInput when component get focused.
		* Add scrollRect hack (http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-177) with mouse scroll component since it was already added with ScrollBar.
		* Fix NumberUtils clamp error with FocusManager (FocusManager complete review)

	Features Added :
		* Button dragOutKeepCurrentState property is renamed to disabledDragOutState to match disabledDragOverState property.
		* Button disabledDragOverState is set as true by default.
		* ComboBoxOpenType class is renamed to ComboBoxTransitionType to better match name with Combobox transitionType property.
		* When text is set with ComboxBox using text property, this now clear current selection. 
		* Added new ComboBoxStepper component, mix between ComboBox and stepper components.
		* list components have now next and previous methods to select next or previous item from current selected cell.
		* Added tweenToPosition and tweenToChild method with scroll components.
		* Components Assets no longer need to implement IAsset class (if so asset factory build an IAsset implementation and add asset as a child) even if implementing IAsset is better when you want to layout your asset while component is resized. 
		* Complete FocusManager and FocusGroup review, hope this is more stable now, you can now create group with DisplayObjectContainer to automatically add container instance.
		* Move scrollrect hack to SizeManager class (getScrollTargetContentSize method) so make it available for personal use.
		* With Form class you can create instance passing form script request as parameter, if so when a component is focus and enter key is pressed this automatically send form to script.
		* Form addField and addFieldAt methods have now all arguments optional (except field of course) since you can inject this arguments directly through component itself.
		* MediaPlayer can now read HTTPPseudo stream and RTMP files.
		* MediaPlayerEvent renamed to StreamEvent, also add BUFFER_EMPTY and PLAY_START event, rename BUFFER_COMPLETE event to BUFFER_FULL.
		* Mediaplayer complete review to include new HTTPPseudo stream and RTMP, hope no regression here.

		* Add arrowButtonPosition property with ComboBox to choose prefered left or right button position.
		* Add scrollBarPosition property with List and ComboBox to choose prefered left or right scroll position.

			var ComboboxClass : Class = getDefinitionByName( "myLib.controls.ComboBox" ) as Class;
			var cb : IComboBox = new ComboBoxClass();
			cb.autoSize = true;
			addChild( cb as DisplayObject );
